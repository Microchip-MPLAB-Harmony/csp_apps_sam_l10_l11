The input signal is connected to the non-inverting (positive) input while the inverting (negative) input and the output is connected in a closed loop with an internal resistor ladder. The OPAMP2 positive input can be multiplexed to I/O pin PA05, hence the input signal to be amplified must be connected to this pin. The pin must also be configured as an input. The ADC input multiplexer needs to be configured (MUXPOS = 0x1F) in order to use the OPAMP2 output as input. In this example OPAMP2 is configured with R2/R1 = 1/3. Thus, the gain for this non-inverting configuration is 1.33.

VDDCORE Brown Out Reset: BOD12 will reset the device if a voltage of 1.2 V or below is observed on the I/O pin supplying power to the MCU core (VDDCORE). VDDANA Brown Out Reset: BOD33 resets the device if the voltage on the VDDANA pin falls below a value configured by the SYSCTRL . ",

    "content": "This example uses the I2C peripheral library in slave mode and emulates an EEPROM of 512 bytes. There are two pages each of size 256 bytes. I2C slave expects two bytes of memory address from the I2C master and the memory address can range from 0x00 to 0x1FF. I2C slave application supports following: . Byte Write: The I2C master sends the slave address, followed by two bytes of memory address. The slave provides the data present at the requested memory address. Page Write: A page write is initiated the same way as a byte write, but the I2C master can write up-to 256 bytes (1 page). If more than 256 bytes are sent by the I2C master to the I2C slave, the memory address will “roll over” and previous data will be overwritten. The address “roll over” during write is from the last byte of the current page to the first byte of the same page. Current Address Read: The internal memory address counter maintains the last address accessed during the last read or write operation, incremented by one. Once the device address with the read/write bit set to one is clocked in and acknowledged by the EEPROM, the data byte at the current address is serially clocked out. After reading the data from the current address, the I2C master sends NAK and generates a STOP condition. Random Read: The I2C master writes the 2 byte memory address and then reads the data from that memory address. After reading the data, the I2C master sends NAK and generates a STOP condition. Sequential Read: Sequential reads are initiated by either a current address read or a random address read. As long as the EEPROM receives an acknowledge, it will continue to increment the memory address and serially clock out sequential data bytes. When the memory address limit is reached (0x1FF), the memory address will “roll over” to 0x00 and the sequential read will continue. The sequential read operation is terminated when the I2C master sends a NAK and generates a STOP condition. To run the application, two evaluation kits will be required - one acting as the I2C master and the other as the I2C slave. The I2C master application to be used for this demo application is available under apps/sercom/i2c/master/i2c_eeprom/firmware folder. I2C master writes an array of values to the I2C slave and verifies the value written by reading the values back and comparing it to the value written. ",
